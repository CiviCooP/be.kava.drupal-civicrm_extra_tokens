CiviCRM Extra Tokens (be.kava.drupal-civicrm_extra_tokens)
==========================================================

Adds extra tokens for use in Drupal (eg as web form default values). 
Exposes tokens for the primary Address, Phone and Email of the user that is currently logged in.  
   
There are two other projects that claim to do this - one that doesn't work (https://www.drupal.org/project/civicrm_entity_address_extra) and one that's 4 years old (https://github.com/druderman/civicrm_token). So here's mine.
